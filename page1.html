            <h3 class = "tit1">Whats the game about</h3>
            <p class = "sec2">The most optimal way to play this game is to imagine yourself as a rebellion droid during a fight scene. More specifically, imagine yourself as the infamous R2D2 and you are attempting to crack a colour code that has been set up by the empire. There is a fight scene currently going on as you attempt to find your way to the terminal to attempt to hack it. The scenario is happening on an Imperial Interceptor while Luke and a few people from the rebellion forces are attempting to escape, however the latch is locked and they are attempting to fight off the stormtroopers storming towards them. If you are not very good at RP, you can instead think of yourself playing mastermind against an opponent AI. Idk man you can imagine a scenario for yourself if you want because you couldn't go with what I told you. But whatever we will ignore your lack of imagination and go on with the game because this is my work and if you have fun with it a different way then go ahead im not stopping you. But you are forced to have fun or else I will walk over to your house and delete your fortnite account. No pressure. Anyways have fun and may the force be with you. Unless you don't enjoy it.</p>

            <p class="sec4">So your most crucial requirement for this game is a brain. After that, you probably need it to function. At this point, you would be able to figure our the basics of the game, but for the sake of having actual useful content on this page so that the big Q will read it and not think I am losing my sanity, <a href="https://www.hasbro.com/common/documents/dad261421c4311ddbd0b0800200c9a66/819DF9B85056900B10B25C68C95E39E5.pdf">here</a> is how you actually play the game. When you first click on the game button at the top in the middle of the nav bar, you will be shown a cut scene and have to wait for it to end before being able to play "mastermind". First of all, you need a keyboard to be able to input any of the 7 input buttons that are available to you. Next your gonna need to guess what the code that the AI created for you is. You can do this in a varied amount of manners using your head. Next, your going to input those colours using the number code provided on the left, and press enter. The game will give you a red pin for each color that is correct, and a black pin for every colour in the correct position. You can use this information to try figuring it out, however the order of them is random so your going to have to try and figure out which colours were the ones that gave you a correct a answer.</p>
